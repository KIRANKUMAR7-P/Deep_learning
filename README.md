# Deep Learning Showcase: Insights and Classifications

Welcome to my Deep Learning Showcase repository! Delve into the captivating world of deep learning through two transformative projects: ATM Data Analysis using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Rice Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These projects showcase my passion for uncovering insights and pushing the boundaries of image classification using cutting-edge techniques.

## ATM Data Analysis using ANN üèß

### Overview

Unlock the hidden stories within financial data! The ATM Data Analysis project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to explore the dynamics of ATM transactions. By preprocessing and engineering features from raw transaction data, I unveil customer behavior, trends, and potential anomalies, empowering businesses with strategic insights.

### Process

1. **Data Wrangling:** Cleanse and reshape raw transaction data into a coherent format.
2. **Feature Crafting:** Engineer meaningful features to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Architecture:** Build an ANN to predict transaction patterns and trends.
4. **Insight Generation:** Extract insights to understand customer behavior and anomalies.

### Model Architecture

For this project, I designed a feedforward neural network with the following layers:
- Input Layer: Accepts feature vectors extracted from transaction data.
- Hidden Layers: Multiple dense layers with varying units and activation functions.
- Output Layer: Single neuron for transaction prediction.

### Libraries and Tools

- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing and evaluation
- TensorFlow for creating and training ANN models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Rice Image Classification using CNN üåæ

### Overview

See the future of crop classification! The Rice Image Classification project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify rice varieties from images. By training a CNN model on a diverse dataset of rice images, I illustrate the power of deep learning in accurate image classification for agricultural applications.

### Process

1. **Image Collection:** Curate a comprehensive dataset of rice images representing different varieties.
2. **Image Preprocessing:** Transform and augment images to enhance model robustness.
3. **Model Architecture:** Experiment with multiple CNN architectures, including Vanilla CNN and VGG-16.
4. **Fine-Tuning:** Apply transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models on rice images.
5. **Training and Validation:** Train the model on labeled images and validate its performance.
6. **Inference and Predictions:** Deploy the model to predict rice varieties from new images.

### Model Architectures

1. **Vanilla CNN:** A simple CNN architecture tailored for image classification.
2. **VGG-16:** A deep CNN architecture known for its excellent performance on image recognition tasks.
3. **Fine-Tuning:** Utilizing pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for rice classification.

### Libraries and Tools

- TensorFlow and Keras for building CNN architectures
- OpenCV for image preprocessing and augmentation
- Matplotlib for visualizing results
